Production Deploy - Text directions, references and code
You can sign-up for a heroku account at: https://www.heroku.com/

Preparation for production deployment:

- Remove sqlite3 gem from top of your Gemfile to within group :development, :test do block

Mine looks like below:

group :development, :test do
  gem 'sqlite3', '~> 1.4'
  gem 'byebug', platforms: [:mri, :mingw, :x64_mingw]
end
- Create a group production ->

group :production do
  gem 'pg'
end
- Save Gemfile

- Run bundle install --without production to update Gemfile.lock file

- Commit your changes to git repo ->

git add -A

git commit -m "Make app production ready"

You can check if you already have Heroku CLI installed by going to your terminal and typing in:

heroku --version

or simply heroku

You can get the Heroku CLI from here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

Check Heroku installation:

heroku --version

heroku # for list of common heroku commands

Once installed, login to your Heroku account from your application directory:

heroku login

To create a new production version of your app hosted in Heroku, use the following command:

heroku create

To push your application code to Heroku and deploy your app, use the command below, but make sure all your code changes are committed by checking git status first (following the steps in the beginning of this text lecture) ->

git push heroku master

To change the name of your application ->

heroku rename newnameofyourapp

replace newnameofyourapp above with the name you'd like to give your app

Your app will then be accessible from the following browser URL ->

https://newnameofyourapp.herokuapp.com
